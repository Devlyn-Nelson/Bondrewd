- Add non-packed little endian
- make field attributes applied to an enum apply the id_field
- fix nested stuff, currently if you want Aligned Little Endian your nested struct must NOT reverse byte-order.
- fix auto-fill bits for failing inline code example.
    - this might require changing the output for `BIT_SIZE`.
